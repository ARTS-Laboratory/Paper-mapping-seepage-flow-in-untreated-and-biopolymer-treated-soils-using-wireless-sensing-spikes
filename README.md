# Paper_Mapping-Seepage-Flow-in-Untreated-and-Biopolymer-Treated-Soils-Using-Wireless-Sensing-Spikes
This folder contains code, data, and plots for 1D kriging for different soil compositions for the paper ICBBG 2025.

* **data**: This folder has raw data named "Three Experiments used_To Mechanical_V2". Here are also three post-processed data for analysis:
  * `compact_sand_final.csv`
  * `0.5% XG Biopolymers_final.csv`
  * `10% Silt_final.csv`

* **plots**: This folder saves all plots after running the code.

* **plot_2D_5spike_data.py**: This code is used for 2D plotting during voltage vs Time (also to show specific time stamps (TS)).

* **kriging_1D_compactedsand.py**: This is 1D kriging code for compacted sand soil composition.
